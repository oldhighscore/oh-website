Cash

A game to be played in the vein of chess with some mods.
The big difference is there is no check or mate.
One must gain coin through the usual capture or,
through moving their piece by moving onto the last rank.
Players switch who goes first to give balance via two games.
There are a total of a hundred coin per game, fifty to each player.
Pieces have been labeled different but behave the same,
with the exception of the step piece which reverses any one death,
its coin, and returns said piece to that spot.

Old Highscore will handle cash earned from playing games,
and work to provide an area for future sagas and generations.
