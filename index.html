        <h1>Cash</h1>

        	Cash

A game to be played in the vein of chess with some mods.
The big difference is there is no check or mates.
One must gain points through the typical capture or,
through cashing their piece by moving onto their last rank.
Players switch who goes first to give balance.
There is a total of a hundred points per game, fifty to each player.
Pieces have been labeled different but behave the same,
with the exception of the step piece which reverses any point,
in addition to returning that piece to that player on that spot.

Old Highscore will handle cash earned from playing games,
and work to provide an area for future sagas and generations.
